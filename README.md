# Hello everybody!ðŸ‘‹
<h3>
 <b>I'm an enthusiastic frontend developer from Turku, Finland.</b>
</h3>
<p>
 I'm currently working and driving frontend development forward at a SaaS company <a href="https://www.lyyti.com"><b>@Lyyti Oy </b></a>. Some part of my week I tend to spend with my company <a href="https://www.dataatti.io"><b>@Dataatti Oy</b></a> helping our customers create value to their users. <img src="https://github.com/PetroSilenius/PetroSilenius/blob/master/images/Lyyti-logo.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Lyyti logo" height="20px" /><img src="https://github.com/PetroSilenius/PetroSilenius/blob/master/images/Dataatti-logo.png?raw=true" alt="Dataatti logo" height="20px" />

 I graduated as a Master of Technology from University of Turku when I was 22 years old and I'm grateful for the lessons I learned. Especially student activity introduced me to great people and tought me a lot. ðŸŽ“

 On my freetime I cycle here and there but also organise a biweekly code club for university students to help them become better developers. I'm also known for my scouting background where I worked on different projects such as a 40-person two week all-inclusive camp in Italy. ðŸš²
