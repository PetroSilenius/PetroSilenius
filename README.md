# Hello everybody!ðŸ‘‹
<h3>
 <b>I'm an enthusiastic developer from Turku, Finland.</b>
</h3>
<p>
 I'm currently working as CTO at <a href="https://ruokaboksi.fi">Ruokaboksi</a> which is a mealkit subscription platform delivering easy, healthy and delicous meals weekly to your home door ðŸ“¦

 I graduated as a Master of Technology from University of Turku when I was 22 years old and I'm grateful for the lessons I learned. Especially student activity introduced me to great people and taught me a lot. ðŸŽ“<img src="https://github.com/PetroSilenius/PetroSilenius/blob/master/images/Digit-logo.png?raw=true" alt="Digit logo" height="20px" /> Some of my favourite memories there are from organising a biweekly code club or organising events for hundreds of participants

 On my freetime I cycle here and there, most recently I've picked up an eletric fatbike which is awesome during the winter. I'm also known for my scouting background where I worked on different projects such as a 40-person two week all-inclusive camp in Italy. ðŸš²<img src="https://github.com/PetroSilenius/PetroSilenius/blob/master/images/HalikonSiniset-logo.png?raw=true" alt="Halikon Siniset logo" height="20px" />
